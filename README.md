# Arm Assembly Tutorial

Check the Wiki for full documentation.

## Installation

To run all the examples, download the cross-compiler [arm-linux-gnueabihf](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest-7/arm-linux-gnueabihf/) from x86_64 processors to ARM, and add the binaries to your `PATH` variable.

You will also need to install `qemu-system-arm`.

## Usage

The Makefiles in this repository are the same ones as in the [makefile-tutorial](https://github.com/ncotti/makefile-tutorial). You can execute the makefile in each folder to follow the examples in the Wiki.

Besides, the folder `asm_testing_area` is provided to make quick assembly tests and prototypes.
