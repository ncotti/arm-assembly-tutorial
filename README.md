# Arm Assembly Tutorial

Check the Wiki for full documentation.

## Instalation

To run all the examples, download cross-compiler [arm-linux-gnueabihf](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest-7/arm-linux-gnueabihf/) from x86_64 processors to ARM, and add the binaries to your `PATH` variable.

## Usage

The Makefile in this repository is the same one as in the [makefile-tutorial](https://github.com/ncotti/makefile-tutorial). Change the variables' values accordingly to the examples that you may want to run.
